# 🛡️ Simple Keylogger (Task-04)
*A Prodigy Infotech Internship Project — Task 04*

Developed by **AREMU DAVID ADEKANOLA**

## 📌 Overview

This project is a basic keylogger program built with Python that listens to and logs keystrokes from the user's keyboard. It captures the keys pressed and saves them to a text file (`key_log.txt`). The program uses the `pynput` library for capturing keyboard input.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is strictly for educational purposes. Always ensure you have proper authorization before running keyloggers on any system.

## 🎯 Features

✅ Captures and logs keystrokes in real time  
✅ Handles both alphanumeric and special keys  
✅ Logs saved in an easy-to-read format in a `.txt` file  
✅ Lightweight and easy to use  

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The script starts listening for keyboard events using the `pynput` library.
2. Whenever a key is pressed, it's recorded and written to `key_log.txt`.
3. Special keys like `Enter`, `Backspace`, `Space`, etc., are handled and logged with square brackets for clarity (e.g., `[Enter]`).

## 🧪 Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- `pynput` library for key listening
